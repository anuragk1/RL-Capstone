    "# Assignment 2 - Implement your agent\n",
    "Welcome to Course 4, Programming Assignment 2! We have learned about reinforcement learning algorithms for prediction and control in previous courses and extended those algorithms to large state spaces using function approximation. One example of this was in assignment 2 of course 3 where we implemented semi-gradient TD for prediction and used a neural network as the function approximator. In this notebook, we will build a reinforcement learning agent for control, again using a neural network for function approximation. This combination of neural network function approximators and reinforcement learning algorithms, often referred to as Deep RL, is an active area of research and has led to many impressive results (e. g., AlphaGo: https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far).\n",

    "## Section 1: Action-Value Network\n",
    "This section includes the function approximator that we use in our agent, a neural network. In Course 3 Assignment 2, we used a neural network as the function approximator for a policy evaluation problem. In this assignment, we will use a neural network for approximating the action-value function in a control problem. The main difference between approximating a state-value function and an action-value function using a neural network is that in the former the output layer only includes one unit whereas in the latter the output layer includes as many units as the number of actions.\n",

    "We have already provided get_action_values() and get_TD_update() methods. The former computes the action-value function by doing a forward pass and the latter computes the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the weights times the TD error. These get_action_values() and get_TD_update() methods are similar to the get_value() and get_gradient() methods that you implemented in Course 3 Assignment 2. The main difference is that in this notebook, they are designed to be applied to batches of states instead of one state. You will later use these functions for implementing the agent."

    "## Section 2: Adam Optimizer\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use the Adam algorithm for updating the weights of your action-value network. As you may remember from Course 3 Assignment 2, the Adam algorithm is a more advanced variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The Adam algorithm improves the SGD update with two concepts: adaptive vector stepsizes and momentum. It keeps running estimates of the mean and second moment of the updates, denoted by $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ respectively: $$\\mathbf{m_t} = \\beta_m \\mathbf{m_{t-1}} + (1 - \\beta_m)g_t \\\\ \\mathbf{v_t} = \\beta_v \\mathbf{v_{t-1}} + (1 - \\beta_v)g^2_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\beta_m$ and $\\beta_v$ are fixed parameters controlling the linear combinations above and $g_t$ is the update at time $t$ (generally the gradients, but here the TD error times the gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are initialized to zero, they are biased toward zero. To get unbiased estimates of the mean and second moment, Adam defines $\\mathbf{\\hat{m}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}$ as: $$ \\mathbf{\\hat{m}_t} = \\frac{\\mathbf{m_t}}{1 - \\beta_m^t} \\\\ \\mathbf{\\hat{v}_t} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v_t}}{1 - \\beta_v^t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights are then updated as follows: $$ \\mathbf{w_t} = \\mathbf{w_{t-1}} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\mathbf{\\hat{v}_t}}+\\epsilon} \\mathbf{\\hat{m}_t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\alpha$ is the step size parameter and $\\epsilon$ is another small parameter to keep the denominator from being zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, you will implement the __init__() and update_weights() methods for the Adam algorithm. In __init__(), you will initialize self.m and self.v. In update_weights(), you will compute new weights given the input weights and an update $g$ (here td_errors_times_gradients) according to the equations above."

Furthermore, as a side note, this kind of model that is not learned and simply a collection of experience can be called non-parametric as it can be ever-growing as opposed to a parametric model where the transitions are learned to be represented with a fixed set of parameters or weights.\n",

    "## Section 4: Softmax Policy\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use a softmax policy. One advantage of a softmax policy is that it explores according to the action-values, meaning that an action with a moderate value has a higher chance of getting selected compared to an action with a lower value. Contrast this with an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy which does not consider the individual action values when choosing an exploratory action in a state and instead chooses randomly when doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of selecting each action according to the softmax policy is shown below: $$Pr{(A_t=a | S_t=s)} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\dot{=} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\frac{e^{Q(s, a)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{b \\in A}e^{Q(s, b)/\\tau}}$$ where $\\tau$ is the temperature parameter which controls how much the agent focuses on the highest valued actions. The smaller the temperature, the more the agent selects the greedy action. Conversely, when the temperature is high, the agent selects among actions more uniformly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a softmax policy exponentiates action values, if those values are large, exponentiating them could get very large. To implement the softmax policy in a numerically stable way, we often subtract the maximum action-value from the action-values. If we do so, the probability of selecting each action looks as follows:\n",
    "$$Pr{(A_t=a | S_t=s)} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\dot{=} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\frac{e^{Q(s, a)/\\tau - max_{c}Q(s, c)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{b \\in A}e^{Q(s, b)/\\tau - max_{c}Q(s, c)/\\tau}}$$\n",
